```yaml
site_name: mkdocs Starter Kit                               # replace with your title
repo_name: mkdocs-starter                                   # replace with your repo name
repo_url: https://github.com/michaellihs/mkdocs-starter     # replace with your repo
```

## 2. Create your first page

1. Add a new page

    Create a file inside the `docs` folder of the repository.

2. Add a file to the navigation structure

    Within the `mkdocs.yaml` (in the root of this repository) add the file in the `nav` section:

    ```yaml
    nav:
      - 'üè† Home': 'index.md'
      - '<TITLE IN NAVIGATION>': '<FILENAME>'
    ```
